      Originally developed by Rocket Mortgage, MassTestingPlatform was created 
      with a specific focus on supporting COVID-19 vaccination testing efforts 
      in Detroit during the height of the pandemic. The platform was designed 
      to facilitate large-scale testing operations and played a crucial role 
      in contributing to the efficient management of testing initiatives during 
      a critical time. The initial development and subsequent open-sourcing were 
      driven by the urgent need to address the challenges posed by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. While the platform remains available for use, there 
      are no plans for ongoing updates or maintenance.
    </p>
    <p class="section__copy">
      This project wouldn't have been possible without the contributions of many individuals.
      The team built and launched the platform in just five days.
