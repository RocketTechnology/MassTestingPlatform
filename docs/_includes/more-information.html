      Mass Testing Platform
    </h2>
    <p class="section__copy">
      Originally developed by Rocket Mortgage, MassTestingPlatform was created 
      with a specific focus on supporting COVID-19 vaccination testing efforts 
      in Detroit during the height of the pandemic. The platform was designed 
      to facilitate large-scale testing operations and played a crucial role 
      in contributing to the efficient management of testing initiatives during 
      a critical time. The initial development and subsequent open-sourcing were 
      driven by the urgent need to address the challenges posed by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. While the platform remains available for use, there 
      are no plans for ongoing updates or maintenance.

      This project wouldn't have been possible without the contributions of many individuals.
      The team built and launched the platform in just five days.
