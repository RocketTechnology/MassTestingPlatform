      Mass Testing Platform is a scheduling, logistics and data orchestration application,
      which was designed in collaboration between Rocket Mortgage,
      Rock Connections and the City of Detroit to facilitate drive-through
      testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <p class="section__copy">
      The documentation on this site will give you a high-level overview
      of the drive-through testing process, from end-to-end. Please note,
      this process was designed around the regulations in effect in
      Detroit, Michigan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, you
      may need to make adjustments to the process and technology to
      meet the current regulations in your area.
